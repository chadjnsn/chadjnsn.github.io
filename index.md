# About

I am an accomplished software engineer with over 12 years of experience in leading, designing, coding, testing, deploying, and maintaining complex and highly scalable software systems within cloud environments.

I have extensive experience across a diverse range of technologies, having worked with Fortune 100 companies, single-person startups, state government agencies, and public universities. My recent focus has been on leveraging machine learning models to detect and mitigate bot activity on a global scale. Additionally, I hold two degrees from Oregon State University: one in Computer Science and another in Business with a specialization in Information Systems.
